# ST558---Project-2
Project 2 for course ST558

This project consists of creating a shiny app to explore a data set obtained from the internet. The app built here uses the Mobile Device Usage and User Behavior Dataset. The app allows the user to select a subset of the Mobile Device Usage dataset by filtering based on categorical variable levels and numeric variable ranges. Then the user can create numerical summaries of the chosen subset of data in the form of contingency tables and summary statistics. The user can also create various customizable plots from the chosen data subset and can download the subsetted data if they please.
